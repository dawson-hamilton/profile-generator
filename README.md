information. 

#tech used

* javascript
* npm extensions like inquirer

#how to use
when you tell the program to run index.js with node it will prompt you with a few questions like what is your first and last name, what 
is your github username and what your favorite color is. when you fill all this out it goes to the html skeleton that I made and 
dynamically creates a pdf profile based on the info from the command line and the info that was gathered from the gihub api call.
